# SiteSync Pro - Railway Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
Railway shows "Starting Container" but doesn't progress. This is fixed with updated configuration.

## Fixed Files

### 1. Updated Procfile
```
web: python main.py
```

### 2. Updated main.py
- Simplified startup process
- Better error handling with full traceback
- Proper port binding for Railway

### 3. Updated requirements.txt
```
Flask==2.3.3
requests==2.31.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
Werkzeug==2.3.7
```

### 4. Added railway.json
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python main.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

### 5. Added runtime.txt
```
python-3.11.7
```

## Next Steps

1. **Upload these updated files to GitHub**
2. **Railway will automatically redeploy**
3. **Check logs for the startup messages**

The app should now start properly and bind to Railway's PORT.

## Alternative: Gunicorn
If Python direct start fails, rename `Procfile.gunicorn` to `Procfile` for gunicorn startup.

## Test Locally
Run `python3 test_app.py` to verify everything works before deployment.
